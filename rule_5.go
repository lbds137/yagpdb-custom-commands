{{ $rText := "**Do not harass other server members, via direct message or otherwise.** This means that you are expected to respect the DM preference roles, the names of which should be self-explanatory. That said, even a member with open DMs may ask you to refrain from messaging them, in which case you are expected to honor their request or else risk facing disciplinary consequences.\n\nFurthermore, please **refrain from sending explicit content of any kind to other members in DMs without prior authorization** (this includes unsolicited sexual advances or photo / video content). This is especially important because, as previously mentioned, minors are permitted to be on the server, and virtually every jurisdiction carries heavy legal penalties for violations of statutes related to sending sexual content of / to minors." }}
