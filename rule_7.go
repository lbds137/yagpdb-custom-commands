{{ $rText := "**Please respect each other.** This applies in all senses of the word “respect”, but in particular it means that you should **refrain from disparaging another member’s beliefs**. It is acceptable (and encouraged) to share your own good / bad experiences and opinions, but please do not state or imply that your experiences are the only “real” / correct / valid ones! You may offer advice if it is requested, but unsolicited “advice” is frowned upon, as is any suggestion that a member shouldn’t interact with the deities they have chosen to approach / worship.\n\nFurthermore, even if you consider yourself to be experienced in your practice, please make an effort to **avoid talking down to people who are less experienced than you**. This can be difficult in practice since different people perceive this differently, but please use your best judgment and make the effort to **accept constructive feedback whenever possible and reasonable to do so**. We strive to help each other, not tear each other down." }}
