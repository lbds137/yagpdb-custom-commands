{{ $rText := "**Please respect the server staff and refrain from “mini-modding”** (i.e. trying to dictate to us how to run the server), **especially when we ask you to relocate or end a conversation that is getting out of hand** (see **Rule #5** regarding harassment). We also ask that you keep in mind that staff members may have their own opinions that they should be able to express freely without speaking officially for the server. **If you are not sure what constitutes personal opinion and what constitutes official policy, please ask!**\n\nWe work hard to keep the server running in an orderly fashion, and we are here to help in any way that we can. **If you have any issues or concerns, please submit a ticket via our ticketing system.** If your issue is with a *specific* staff member, please send a DM to *any other* member of the staff, who will address the issue confidentially." }}
