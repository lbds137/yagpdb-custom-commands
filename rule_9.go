{{ $rText := "**To the best of your ability, please stay on-topic.** We aim to keep the server organized by topic / interest, so please respect this by doing your part and moving conversations to the appropriate channel whenever it makes sense to do so. **In particular, conversations of a sensitive nature, e.g. describing mental health challenges or self-harm ideation, should be constrained to the appropriate channel in the sensitive content section.**\n\nFurthermore, **please do not engage in spamming**. The Night House is not your personal platform for spreading questionable “messages” or dumping useless content without engaging with the main subject of the server, which is occultism in general with a particular emphasis on the Left Hand Path and related spiritual paths / approaches. This is naturally a subjective matter that will be dealt with according to the discretion of the staff, but in general you should balance your quantity of “shitposting” with quality discussion of occult topics. *If you are copy-pasting the same questionable content across several servers, then you are probably falling afoul of this rule and will be dealt with accordingly.*" }}
