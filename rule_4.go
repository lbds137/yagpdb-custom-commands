{{ $rText := "**Do not post NSFW content (i.e. content related to sex / drugs) outside of the NSFW section, and do not post suggestive content depicting minors *anywhere* in the server.** NSFW content is permitted (and encouraged) but is restricted to its own dedicated, role-locked section in order to protect any minors that may be on the server. Occasional low-brow jokes / innuendo are permitted, as is language of a coarse nature, but the goal is for the bulk of the server to be **“PG-13”**. In accordance with this policy, please keep all of the **“R”** or **“NC-17”** content to the NSFW section.\n\n**__Important note__: posting lewd imagery of minors is an *instantly bannable offense*, and *ignorance is not a valid defense.*** Not only is it highly illegal, but it is also disgusting and upsetting to our members." }}
